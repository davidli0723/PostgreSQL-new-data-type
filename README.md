# PostgreSQL-new-data-type
This repo implements a new data type for PostgreSQL, complete with input/output functions, comparison operators and the ability to build indexes on values of the type.

A new base type PostAddress is created to represent postal system. A useful set of operations on values of type PostAddress is defined and indexes on PostAddress attributes is created for fast searching.
